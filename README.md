shell script taht list the resources in the AWS


Developed a shell script to automate the discovery and listing of AWS resources (S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users) across the account.

Integrated AWS CLI commands within the script to fetch real-time metadata such as instance details, public/private IPs, security groups, S3 bucket names, IAM user details, and Lambda configurations.

Implemented structured JSON parsing and formatted output for clear reporting of resource usage.

Enhanced visibility into cloud infrastructure by generating consolidated reports for auditing, monitoring, and cost optimization.

Strengthened hands-on expertise with AWS services, IAM security, and automation using Shell scripting.
